		<h3>The Jump</h3>

		find weapons on the ground near buildings or in chests. They later grab
		materials to help them fight the first people they encounter.

		<h3>Approaching storm</h3>
		<p>
		As each player collects better and better loot, players must strategize and plan out offensive attacks, 
		while avoiding the storm. The storm gets closer and closer and being in it brings your health down at a rapid rate.
		Along with chests and ammo crates, supply drops start to fall, as they carry very valuable items.
		All players at this point must be better equipped with weapons and heal-ables,
		as they try to keep themselves alive from both players and the storm.
