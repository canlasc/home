		<h2>Sniper</h2>
		<p>
		This weapon does a large amount of damage when hit by it. It is used for long range combat.
		When hit by this weapon in the head, you are instantly knocked down and eliminated.
		This is because this weapon uses heavy bullets, which do a large amount of damage per shot.

		<h2>Shotgun</h2>
		<p>
		This weapon fires many bullets when the triggered is pulled. The shotgun is used for close combat and
		when all the bullets hit the player, it usually knocks down and eliminates the enemy. Due to the fact that
		it does so much damage, a pump action was included to create a delayed time before it can be fired again.
